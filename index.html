            <h1>fast for the world: <u>the common rule</u></h1>
        </header>
        <p>we fast from sundown sunday through all of monday until sundown tuesday, every week.</p>

        <p>we do not attend to religion, motivation, experience, circumstance, hopes, dreams, feelings, thoughts, ideas, words, relationships, diets, special pleadings, etc.</p>
       
        <p>we avoid discussing fftw with others, or fasting in general, especially while fasting, for <strong>action makes, speech unmakes.</strong></p>


        <header>
            <h1>fast for the world: <u>the common goal</u></h1>
        </header>
        <p>it is likely that critical answers to our current societal problems cannot be evoked by new informaton (speech).</p>

        <p>answers might, however, be convoked through disciplined habit (action).</p>

        <p>fasting together, we hope our common discipline manifests an egregore that might bring answers into view for those who seek them.</p>

        </header>
        
        <h3>q. who are you exactly?</h3>
        <p>a. we are somebodies and nobodies, and do not matter.  that more people fast in common is what matters.</p>

        <p>a. no.  be who you are, just put the fork down for a spell and shut up about it, while others do the same.  this isn’t hard.</p>

        <h3>q. is this a health thing, or a prayer thing, or a spiritual thing, or a psychological thing, or a charity thing, or a…?</h3>
        <p>a. no.  do it for whatever reasons motivate you, do it even in spite of yourself, just stop talking about it.  <strong>action makes, speech unmakes.</strong></p>

        <h3>q. is this a political thing, a social justice thing, a marxist thing, a weird cult thing, an education thing, or a…?</h3>
        <p>a. no.  just push away from the table for a while and shut up about it, while others do the same.  this really isn’t hard.</p>

        <h3>q. ackshually, fasting is unhealthy because reasons, look how smart i am with muh credentials and muh science and muh hyperlinks and muh peer review, etc.</h3>

        <h3>q. can we get together in real life, in the real world?</h3>
        <p>a. no. be family and friend to your family and friends.  just stop shoveling groceries down your throat for a bit and shut up about it.  this really, really, isn’t hard.</p>

        <h3>q. why should i care about the world enough to fast for it?</h3>
        <p>a. good question.  disciplined action in common might bring you and us closer to an answer in a way that informed discussion will not.  good luck.</p>

        <h3>q. everything sucks, you suck, you won’t achieve anything, i have daddy issues, my mom's boyfriend is mean to me, be demoralized! fml, etc.</h3>
        <p>a. see the common faq.  also, stop masturbating to internet porn, or stop whoring online.</p>

        <h3>q. i am an influencer and i want to expand my grift by pretending i know all about fasting and egregores and care deeply about latest thing™. can we talk?</h3>

        <h3>q. i want to donate money to your cause, i want to help you monetize the fftw brand, i want to pay you to change this one little thing about fftw, etc. </h3>
        <p>a. fftw is not a cause, nor a brand, nor an indulgance for sale, there is nothing here to buy.</p>

        <h3>q. what if somebody like offers me food while I’m like fasting? like, I’m at a party because I’m like popular, and I just have to eat like out of respect because I’m like a good person, etc.</h3>
        <p>a. try “no thanks, I’m not hungry” or “no thank you, i’m full”.</p>

        <h3>q. can i drink water, can i drink coffee or tea or broth, can i take a supplement, etc.</h3>
        <p>a. we fast on water only, but all fasts for all reasons are welcome.</p>

        <h3>q. does fftw have a that social media over there™ account that i can follow for the latest news tips and tricks, where i can pretend i belong to something by pressing shallow reaction buttons, as i engage in hopeless argumentation with perfect strangers, npcs and bots in fake commment threads, seeking validation to fill my empty soul?</h3>
        <p>a. no.  sounds like a fast would do you good.</p>

        <h3>q. your nazi! racist! homophobic! antisemitic! transphobic! islamophobic! white supremacist! communist! hater! etc.</h3>
        <p>a. you’re.</p>
